One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb`s depths and speak its command word.

Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call.

Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book‚Äôs various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.\n\nThe Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.\n\nA heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book‚Äôs contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book‚Äôs open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can‚Äôt be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.\n\nBenefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.\n\n**Random Properties.** The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:\n2 minor beneficial properties\n2 major beneficial properties\n\n**Increased Wisdom.** After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can‚Äôt gain this benefit from the book more than once.\n\n**Enlightened Magic.** Once you‚Äôve read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.\n\n**Halo.** Once you‚Äôve read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo‚Äôs bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.\n\n**Destroying the Book.** It is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can‚Äôt be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse.

Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.\n\nOther practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can‚Äôt be divined.\n\nNature can‚Äôt abide the book‚Äôs presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.\n\nA creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book‚Äôs contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.\n\nWhenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature‚Äôs alignment changes to neutral evil.\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can‚Äôt be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.\n\nRandom Properties. The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:\n3 minor beneficial properties\n1 major beneficial property\n3 minor detrimental properties\n2 major detrimental properties\n\n**Adjusted Ability Scores.** After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can‚Äôt adjust your ability scores again.\n\n**Mark of Darkness.** After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.\n\n**Command Evil.** While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can‚Äôt use this property again until the next dawn.\n\nDark Lore. You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.\n\n**Dark Speech.** While you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.\n\n**Destroying the Book.** The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.\n\nIf a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.\n\nA creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 √ó 100 years later.\n\nIf all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.",hasattack:0,useasresource:0},{category:"Adventuring Gear",itemname:"Cap of Water Breathing",weight:0,itemmodifiers:"Item Type: Adventuring Gear",itemproperties:"",itemcontent:"While wearing this cap underwater, you can speak its command word as an action to create a bubble of air around your head.

Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn`t escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.\n\nOrcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.\n\nSome say that Vecna`s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King`s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna`s tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One`s will in the world.\n\nThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately.

The eye regains 1d4+4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM`s control.\n\n**Properties of the Eye and Hand.** If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:\n\n* You are immune to disease and poison.\n\n* Using the eye`s X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.\n\n* You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can`t be surprised.\n\n* If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.\n\n* If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna.
